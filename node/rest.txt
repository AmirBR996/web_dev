REST API
API => Application Programming Interface
REST => Representational State Transfer (architectural style)

1. Stateless
Each client request must contain all the information needed to process it.
Server does NOT store client session data.
Improves scalability and reliability.

2. Resources
Everything is treated as a resource (user, product, order, etc.).
Each resource is identified using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
Example: /users, /products/10

3. Uniform Resource Naming
Use nouns (not verbs) for endpoints.
Actions are performed using HTTP methods, not endpoint names.
Example:
  Correct: GET /users
  Wrong:  GET /getUsers

4. HTTP Methods
GET    -> Retrieve data (read-only, no side effects)
POST   -> Create a new resource
PUT    -> Update entire resource
PATCH  -> Update partial resource
DELETE -> Remove a resource
(Choose either PUT or PATCH for updates, not both)

5. HTTP Status Codes
Status codes indicate the result of the request.

100–199 -> Informational
Example: 100 Continue

200–299 -> Success
200 OK        -> Request successful
201 Created   -> Resource created successfully
204 No Content-> Success but no response body

300–399 -> Redirection
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found

400–499 -> Client Errors
400 Bad Request        -> Invalid request format
401 Unauthorized      -> Authentication required
403 Forbidden         -> No permission to access
404 Not Found         -> Resource does not exist
409 Conflict          -> Duplicate or conflict data

500–599 -> Server Errors
500 Internal Server Error -> Server failure
501 Not Implemented      -> Method not supported
503 Service Unavailable  -> Server temporarily down

Additional REST Principles
- Client-Server Architecture
- Cacheable responses (improves performance)
- Layered system (security, load balancers)
- Use JSON or XML (JSON is most common)
- Versioning (e.g., /api/v1/users)
